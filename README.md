Rock Paper Scissors – JavaScript Console Game

📝 About the Project

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game created as part of The Odin Project Foundations curriculum. The game runs entirely in the browser console and demonstrates basic JavaScript concepts such as:

Functions

Conditional Statements

User Input (via prompt())

Score Tracking with Variables

🚀 How to Play
Open the rock_paper_scissor.html file in your browser (preferably using Live Server in VS Code).

The browser will prompt you 5 times to choose rock, paper, or scissors.

After each round, you’ll get an alert with the result.

After 5 rounds, the final score is logged to the browser console.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML for the page structure (minimal).

JavaScript for the game logic.

Browser Prompt/Alert for player interaction.

Console Output for final results.

🧠 What I Learned
How to write JavaScript functions.

How to get user input with prompt().

How to generate random choices for the computer.

How to apply conditionals (if...else) to compare choices.

How to repeat logic without loops (by manually calling functions).

How to display results using alert() and console.log().

🚧 Possible Improvements
Replace prompt() and alert() with custom HTML buttons and messages.

Add input validation to handle incorrect player inputs.

Use loops or arrays to reduce repetitive code.

Improve the user interface with CSS.

Add a restart game option.
